# Jarifier
<h3><b>HOW TO USE</b></h3>
<p>First time when you run "run.bat" program will ask you to place your "Main.java" file in the "input" folder, which will be stored in the same directory as program itself.</p>
<p>Once that is done, press enter and you can choose name of your compiled jar file.</p>
<p>If you didn't mess anything, there should be waiting a brand new .jar file waiting to be run!</p>
